{"name":"Mortise Chisel","aliases":["Mortising Chisel","Mortise Tool"],"description":"A Mortise Chisel is a specialized woodworking tool designed for creating precise rectangular holes, known as mortises, in wood. It features a robust, thick blade that can withstand significant driving force, allowing it to cut through the wood fibers cleanly. Mortise chisels have a long handle that provides leverage and control, making them ideal for use in joinery, particularly in creating joints for legs and rails in furniture construction."}
