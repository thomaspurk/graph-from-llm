{"name":"Tongue and Groove Joint","aliases":["T&G Joint","Tongue and Groove","TG Joint"],"description":"A tongue and groove joint is a type of joinery used primarily in connecting two pieces of wood by creating a protruding 'tongue' on one board which fits snugly into a corresponding 'groove' on another board. This joint is commonly used in flooring, paneling, and cabinetry, providing a strong and aesthetic connection that allows for some expansion and contraction of the wood.","operations":["Cutting the Tongue","Cutting the Groove","Trimming for Fit"]}
