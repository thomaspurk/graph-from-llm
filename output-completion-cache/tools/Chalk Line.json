{"name":"Chalk Line","aliases":["Chalk Reel","Chalk Box"],"description":"A chalk line is a tool used to mark long, straight lines on flat surfaces. It consists of a string, usually coated with chalk powder, housed in a reel that allows for controlled release and retrieval of the string. When the string is stretched taut and then snapped, it leaves a chalk line representing a straight line on the surface below."}
