{"name":"Mortising Machine","aliases":["Mortiser","Mortise Machine","Mortise Chisel Machine"],"description":"A mortising machine is a woodworking tool designed to create square or rectangular holes (mortises) in wood. This tool can be either hand-operated or machine-assisted, and it is typically used for joinery work, particularly in the construction of furniture and doors. The machine is equipped with a chisel that chisels out the wood to form a precise mortise, allowing for a snug fit with tenons."}
