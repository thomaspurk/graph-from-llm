{"name":"Spline Joint","aliases":["Groove Joint","Splined Joint"],"description":"A Spline Joint is a type of woodworking joint that utilizes a thin strip of wood, known as a spline, to connect two pieces of wood. The joint is created by cutting grooves into the edges of the boards that will be joined, allowing the spline to fit snugly in the grooves, providing alignment and increased surface area for bonding.","operations":["Cutting Grooves","Shaping Spline","Inserting Spline"]}
