{"name":"Hand Scraper","aliases":["Card Scraper","Scraping Tool"],"description":"The hand scraper is a finely made woodworking tool used for finishing and smoothing surfaces, typically wood. It consists of a flat piece of steel with a sharp edge that is held at an angle to the woodâ€™s surface, allowing woodworkers to remove thin shavings and achieve a smooth finish. Hand scrapers are particularly effective in finishing intricate areas where sandpaper may not reach, and they are preferred for their control and versatility, especially on delicate work."}
