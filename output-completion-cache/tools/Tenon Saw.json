{"name":"Tenon Saw","aliases":["Dovetail Saw","Back Saw"],"description":"The Tenon Saw is a type of hand saw with a stiff back that helps keep the blade straight during cuts. It features a relatively fine-toothed blade designed for creating precise, clean cuts in wood, particularly for joints such as tenons and mortises. The handle is typically ergonomically shaped and may be made from wood or plastic, allowing for better control while cutting."}
