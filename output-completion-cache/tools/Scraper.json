{"name":"Scraper","aliases":["Cabinet Scraper","Card Scraper"],"description":"A scraper is a hand tool used in woodworking for smoothing and finishing surfaces. It typically consists of a flat piece of metal with a sharp edge that is drawn across wood to remove thin shavings, allowing for a smooth finish without using sandpaper. Scrapers are particularly effective for removing glue squeeze-out and can help achieve a glass-like finish on wood surfaces."}
