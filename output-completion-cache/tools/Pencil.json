{"name":"Pencil","aliases":["Graphite Pencil","Wood Pencil","Carpenter's Pencil"],"description":"A pencil is a writing instrument used for marking wood surfaces, allowing woodworkers to make precise measurements and layout lines. It typically consists of a core made of graphite encased in wood, although there are also mechanical variants. Carpenter's pencils have a flat shape that prevents them from rolling off work surfaces and allows for a finer line when marking on rough materials."}
